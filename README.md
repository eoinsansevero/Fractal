# Fractal
Fractal Visualization Codes

Goals:
1. develop sierpinski triangle visualization.
2. update sierpinski triangle to 3D for visualization.
3. Learn more about the chaos game theory and incorporate this into a final update of sierpinski.py

4. begin development of chaos game program.
  -options including sierpinski triangle, but also various other shapes.
5. develop a nicer interface than command line or user prompted inputs
6. Perfect the program

Bonus: explore the idea of the fact that if you disable certain regions within the shape to not be allowed to have points, then that
disabled region is repeated in a fractal.
